# Word_Coder

This app can code your teXT and also uncode if you want to read this text.

For example:

Class Coder -> Input:  karlz bandz
            -> Output: &1Z7BP21T4B
            
Class Uncoder
           -> Input:  &1Z7BP21T4B
           -> Output: karlz bandz
           
           
    OF COURSE EVERYONE CAN USE THIS CODE AND MODIFY FOR OWN USE
